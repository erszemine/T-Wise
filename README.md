Tesla Stock Tracking and Warehouse Management

Project Description
This project has been developed to streamline the inventory management processes in Tesla's factories. The system allows for tracking product stock, sending alerts for low stock, and making the supply process more organized. Users can quickly perform inventory operations using QR codes and barcodes, digitizing the warehouse management process.

Proposal:
•	Facilitate Inventory Management: Systematically track the inbound and outbound movements of products within the warehouse.
•	Quick and Accurate Transactions: Register and update products in the system quickly using barcodes and QR codes.
•	Monitor Critical Stock Levels: Send automatic notifications when stock falls below a certain threshold.
•	Efficient Supply Process: Automate the ordering process by notifying suppliers for out-of-stock products.

Software Requirements Specification (SRS):
•	User Interface: A web-based interface will allow users to interact with the system.
•	Inventory Management: The stock levels of products (electric vehicles, spare parts, etc.) in the warehouse will be trackable and can be updated.
•	Reporting: Reports on warehouse activities can be generated. Data such as stock status, shipment details, and inventory changes will be presented visually.
•	Database Integration: MySQL will be used to store stock information in the database.
•	API Integration: APIs will be used to send warehouse data to other systems and retrieve data from external systems.
